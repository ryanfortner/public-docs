Luckily, as a group of experts, we often have pioneering and groundbreaking solutions to some of the most simple problems and, in keeping with the open-source spirit, frequently they do not cost money, but rather time, effort, and energy.

Furthermore, we will provide limited support during OS build stage, but you are expected to know what you are doing. There are some important considerations when building your VPS, which we have detailed below: You will need to use the virtual console to manage your instance; You will need to have an understanding of Linux/*nix sysadmin; We do not operate DHCP.

If you don't know how to create an SSH key, take a look here to learn how to create one. When we provide handover details of your instance, we will whenever possible, set it up so that, when you connect for the first time, you connect using your key rather than a plain password. This is possible by using automated builds for the VMs, which offers a consistent baseline image and configuration. It is your responsibility to modify your SSH configuration by removing plain password authentication, changing the SSH port to lock it down and disabling root login. We do not recommend leaving plain password authentication open because it will be targeted with attacks to force entry. If you absolutely and cannot use public keys, you must consider using fail2ban or a similar tool to limit password guesses. Typically, most Linux/*BSD operating systems will all have a sshd_config and, although there are some minor variations, they are typically the same for a standard distribution. Please note that we cannot capture and produce docs for each operating system, so you must use the following as a guide only. If you need specific assistance with a more exotic operating system, please contact us. How to access the sshd_config \u00b6 Log into your server and, through the command-line, use the following commands (using nano as a text editor): cd /etc/ssh nano sshd \\_ config Use ctrl +x to exit nano, you will be asked to save your changes \"Save modified buffer?\" and you type 'y' (for yes - you can enter 'n' or 'c' to quit and make no changes) Disable Root log in \u00b6 Once you have connected to your server and created an unprivileged account that you have verified works with SSH, you can disable root logins by setting the _PermitRootLogin no_ directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on your server and then restarting the server\u2019s SSH process with a command like _sudo systemctl restart sshd_ . Limit which users can log in \u00b6 When having more than a user account, it is advisable to limit which accounts can log in via SSH. This configuration can be achieved in the /etc/ssh/sshd_conf file by setting up the AllowUsers directive and then restarting the server\u2019s SSH process with a command like _sudo systemctl restart sshd_ . An example follows: AllowUsers alice bob Disable version 1 of the SSH Protocol (when applicable) \u00b6 Some operating systems provide support to version 1 of the SSH Protocol.
